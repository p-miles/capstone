# Introduction

## Background

As a manager, it is important to consider how your expectations of employees could impact their ability to maintain a healthy work-life balance, since worker productivity is dependent on the degree to which basic needs have been met.

To borrow from Aristotle,
> "Man is by nature a social animal."

So, it seems that social connection might qualify as a basic human need that impacts productivity.

Aristotle also claims that
> "Society precedes the individual... Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god."

But how do we help each other find the right level of social connection, so that we can thrive in that sweet spot between distraction and isolation?

This two-tailed postulate suggests that people who are not actively social will tend to be on the extremes when it comes to performance. In general, is this true? When people develop close relationships with others, is their overall productivity inherently different from those who aren't as connected to others?

## The Data

The University of Minho's Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva collected [this data](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf) regarding student grades, demographics, social and school related features on high school students during the 2005-6 school year in Portugal for the purpose of using data mining techniques to predict secondary school performance.

Some of the data was obtained from school records, while information for other features was gathered through questionnaires conducted by Cortez and Silva.


## Question and Hypothesis

For now, it would be useful to look at smaller-scale relationships between productivity and social connection. While we might not be able to collect data on all humans that precisely measures productivity and social activity, there is available data on social, demographic, and educational features that we might be able to leverage so that we might have a better understanding of this relationship.

Can we predict a student's relationship status based on their academic performance and outcomes?

MVP
1. Encode features so that data can be analyzed via logistic regression
2. Leverage Cross Validation to aid in model/feature selection
3. Using the CV selected model, conduct logistic regression analysis to explore how well the 'best' model can predict relationship status using educational outcomes/characteristics

# Exploratory Data Analysis

### Groups

* 395 students in Math courses
* 649 students in Portuguese courses

For both groups, the odds of being in a relationship were roughly 1:2

### Feature Categories

* Demographic Characteristics:

       school, sex, age, address, traveltime, internet, health

* Social Connection:

      famsize, Pstatus, Medu, Fedu, Mjob, Fjob, reason, guardian, schoolsup, famsup, paid, nursery, famrel, goout, Dacl, Walc

* Eductional Performance and Outcomes:

      studytime, failures, activities, higher, freetime, romantic, G1, G2, G3, absences

So, as we can see from both of these plots, the grade features (G1, G2, and G3) are strongly correlated. Since these variables each represent a given students' grade in the class at different periods throughout the year, it seems reasonable to simply use the final grade (G3) for the purposes of this analysis.

# Model Selection

## Logistic Regression

Using SKLearn's LogisticRegression, since we are using our data to predict the probability of a binary variable being positive.

### Cross Validation

Using SKLearn's StratifiedKFold to preserves the percentage of samples from each class.

## Test Metric: F1 Score
Since the hypothesis that students who are in a relationship simply perform differently than those who are not in a relationship is two-tailed in nature, it's equally desirable to reduce false positives and false negatives. 

Essentially, we want to pick up on the signal when it exists, and still be able to ignore false alarms. While accuracy might initially seem like a good metric to use, it can be deceiving in that proportionately high numbers of both false positives and false negatives can yield a seemingly "good" accuracy scores. 

Thus, we will use the F1 score for reflecting the model's ability to reduce both false positives and false negatives alike.

## Feature Selection
Evaluating the performance of 3 models with varying features:

    1. Full model uses all 69 predictors
    2. Secondary model uses 29 predictors, using demographic and educational performance features
    3. Third model uses 18 predictors, focusing on educational outcomes only

## Hyperparameter Tuning 
Used SKLearn's GridSearch to find the best values for the following hyperparameters.

| Hyperparameter | Math Dataset Optimal Value | Portuguese Dataset Optimal Value |
|---|---|---|
| penalty | 'l1' | 'l2' |
| C (inverse of regularization param) | 7.743 | 1.0 |

# Chosen Model

## Specifications
    threshold=0.5
    class_weight = 'balanced'
    penalty = l1 (MATH), l2 (PORTUGUESE)
    C = 7.742636826811269 (MATH), 1.0 (PORTUGUESE)

For both Math and Portuguese students, the 3rd model that I tested performed the best, which contained only features on educational outcomes.

This best model used measures on the following features:

        ['absences', 'G3', 'activities', 'higher', 'studytime_2', 'studytime_3', 'studytime_4', 'failures_1', 'failures_2', 'failures_3', 'freetime_2', 'freetime_3', 'freetime_4', 'freetime_5', 'health_2', 'health_3', 'health_4', 'health_5']


## Model Assessment

### CV & Performance Metrics

Using a 0.5 predicted probability threshold and 5-fold Cross Validation, we obtained the following evaluation metrics with this model:

    Math Students: 46.1% F1 score
    Portuguese Students: 50.1% F1 score

# Conclusion
It does seem that there is a statistically significant difference between students who are in a relationship and those who are not for certain educational outcome characteristics. For both Portuguese and Math students, their final grades were statistically significant predictors of whether or not a given student is in a relationship. Interestingly, in both cases, a given student will have an average of 5.8% or 3.8% (respectively) lower odds of being in a relationship for each additional point they have for their final grade. 

In other words, students with higher final grades are less likely to be in relationships. However, the magnitude of this effect seems to be fairly small (a 3.8-5.8% change) compared to other predictors. For example, students who had 2 prior class failures had large increases in their odds of being in a relationship: for Math students, it was a 240% increase, while Portuguese students had an average of 77.6% increase in these odds. The number of absences and the amount of time that students spend studying on a weekly basis was also significant predictors for both groups. 

Overall, it does seem that there's a difference in the educational performance and participation of students who are in a relationship compared to those who aren't. Interestingly, students who have higher numbers of absences, have a previous history of poor academic achievement, and who have lower final grades tend to have higher odds of being in a romantic relationship. 

Therefore, the evidence presented in this study seems to refute the idea that "gods" and "beasts" are equally common among the less social, since it supports romantic social connection as being correlated with lower participation and performance in the community. However, it's important to note that this study is solely examining romantic partnership, which can often turn into a more isolating form of social connection that leads to less involvement in the greater community.
